What is Selenium Tool?
-Automates browser (only web app can be tested)
-Created by Jason Huggins in 2004. Initially named as JavaScriptTestRunner later chamged as Seleium Core.

Why we go for Selenium?
	- Very popular, free and open source.
	- Language support (Java,Python,Ruby,C#,JavaScript etc.,)
	- Automating Web application (Basic to advanced)
	- Large Community Support
	- Cross browser compatibility (Supports all browser)
	- Platform compatibility
	- Integration with other framework and libraries(TestNG,JUnit,POI,ExtentReport etc.,)

Selenium 3 Architecture:

Client
Java -> JSON Wire Protocal -> Server Webdriver -> Web Browser 
(Open the browser) 

JSON Wire Protocal --> transfers data between client and server.

Chrome --> ChromeDriver
Edge --> EdgeDriver

Selenium 4 Architecture:

Client Java -> Server WebDriver -> Web browser

Webdriver is binded with W3C protocol 

W3C Protocol - stands for World Wide Web Consortium

Why? Browser started using first, so selenium also upgraded. 

Advantages:
	- We can maintain the standard
	- Stability - we have common protocol between selenium and browser.
	- Common code for all the browser

Difference between Selenium 3 and 4:
1. Selenium 3 uses - JSON wire Protocol
   Selenium 4 uses - W3C Protocol 

Features added:
	1. Capture screenshot of webelement
	2. Open new tab on browser
	3. Open new window on browser
	4. Object location (get the location of the element) 

Selenium Components:
--------------------
1. Selenium IDE 
2. Selenium Remote Control
3. Selenium Webdriver
4. Selenium Grid

1. Selenium IDE 
	- Used to test application without writing any script.
	- It's an extension which we add to the browser
	- To record and playback 
	- It gives Selenius command
	- Add-on for FireFox 
	- It can be converted in many programming languages like Java, C#,Ruby etc.,

2. Selenium Remote Control (RC):
	- Its the first tool of Selenium Suite
	- Lets us to write the test scripts with multiple language like Java,Python etc.,
	- We need to switch on the server 

Test Script  --> RC Server --> Browser 
	
	- It interacts with the server first then interacts with the browser.

3. Selenium WebDriver:
	- Lets us to write the test scripts with multiple language like Java,Python etc.,
	- No need for any remote server in between
	- With this we can interact with web browser using webdriver interface 

4. Selenium Grid:
	- Hub - controls the execution 
	- node - execution takes places.
	- It is used for parallel testing or distributive testing
	- It allows us ti execute the test scripts on different machines at same time.
	- There is a HUB which controls the execution on various machines called nodes.


Hub --> node 1
    --> node 2 




Client Java -> Server WebDriver -> Web browser

WebdriverManager dependancy -> helps us to access the browser according to the version we have in our system.
