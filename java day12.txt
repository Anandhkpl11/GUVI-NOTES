Difference  b/w Abstract class & Interface
Interface Implementation
Regular Expression 
Java Streams

Interface:
	When you want to have only abstract methods you can go for interface. 
	By default, the methods of interface will be public and abstract.
	Its not a class. 
	Object cannot be created. 
	When you want to use interface, use "implements" keyword
	The fields/variables in interface by default they are static and final. 
	
Why static and final?
	Static --> Objects cannot be created for interface, so to access the interface variables without object
			they are static. 
	final -> Interface cannote have it's own memory so it is given as final.

Ex:

1. Create 3 interfaces - have 2 methods
2. One interface should extend the other.
3. Have 1 abstract class
4. Have a concrette class
5. Create object for concette and excute all the method.

Regular Expression:  -- Regex
	"This is day11 class" --> day11 is present or not.
		contains();

pass --> alphanumeric  -- 8 letters, 2 numbers, 1 special.
"Leemajos@12"  -- craete a formula

API for defining string pattern that can be used for searching, manipulating and editing a string in java.

java.util.regex;

	1. Pattern class -> Defines a pattern(to be used in a search).
	2. Matcher class -> Used to search for the pattern.
	3. PatternSyntaxException -> Indicates syntax error in regular expression pattern.

Pattern.compile(); -- it describes what is being searched.
matcher() - used to search for a pattern in a string. 
find() - returns true if the pattern was found in the string and returns false if it's not found.4
