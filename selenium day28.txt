Creating Tests with Page Factory
Implementation of Test Cases using POM Framework

Page Object Model: It's not a framework, its a design pattern

=> Design pattern for UI automation framework
=> Its similar techniques like a UI developer design their screen
=> For each page we will write script.

Eg: Login fnc., 

	2 pages -< HomePage and LoginPage
		2 java class -> Homepage.java  LoginPage.java

Ecah page -> represented as a class
Each webelement in the page -> represented as a properties of the class

4 components (We will be creating 4 packages):

1. base --> Project Specification methods (Launching the browser, loading the url and closing the browser)
2. pages  --> Homepage.java  LoginPage.java
3. utils  --> All the common codes that is going to repeat more than once e.g: Reading the excel, sendkeys, click, explicit wait etc.,
4. test  --> Maintain the testcasec eg: TC001_Logintest.java TC002_SignupTest.java TC003_Add_Item_To_Cart.java
