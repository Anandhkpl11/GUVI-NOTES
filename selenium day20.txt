What is Maven?
	Build tool provided by Apache Software.

Why maven? 
	1. You need to manually dowmload jar files for 3rd party dependency.
	2. version update, we need to manually change it. 


When we create a maven project pom.xml will be created - pom.xml helps you to control the project.

Project Object Model - pom

2 things:
	1. Dependencies - download 3rd party lib.
	2. plugins - configuration (compile and run as Maven)

2. Generate Report 
3. Packaging


1. src/main/java --> development source code. Code developed by developer.
2. src/main/resource --> 3rd party external resource that developers will be using.
3. src/test/java --> tester will write test scripts. 
4. src/test/resource -->  3rd party external resource that tester will be using.

How it works internally:
	- Inside <dependencies> tag we will sepcify all the jar files we need.
	- Maven local repo will be created and store all the jar files from the remote.
	- Version update -> remove older version from  local and dowmload the latest version from remote. 

To convert Java projecr to Maven:
Right click on project -> Configure -> Convert to Maven

To debug:

First have breakpoints --> Double click on the line number 
DebugAs -> Java Application
To go to the next line -> Fn + F6 

To import maven project:
	File -> import -> Maven -> Existing maven project -> choose the project location -> Finish 

To import java project:
	File -> import -> General -> Existing project into workspace -> choose the project location -> Finish
