AutoIT:
-> Automating window element cannot be done using selenium
-> To communicate with desktop element we can use AutoIT.
-> It's small tool, that has it's own scripting language to interact with Desktop element, to
target
any element available in the desktop.
Why?
Selenium can only automate browser elements and not desktop element.
Commands/Methods:
1. ControlClick() --> simulate a mouse click on windows element.
2. ControlFocus() --> sends a command to specific control of a window.
3. ControlGetText() --> Retreive the text
4. WinClose
5. WinExit
6. Sleep --> to provide delay
7. WinActive
8. ControlSetText() --> simulate sendkeys
